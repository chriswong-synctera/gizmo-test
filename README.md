# gizmo-test

This repository contains a minimal demo site suitable for publishing with GitHub Pages.

**GitHub Pages**
- **Public URL (expected):** `https://chriswong-synctera.github.io/gizmo-test/`
- To publish: push `index.html` to the `main` branch and enable Pages from the repository Settings → Pages, using the **'main' branch / root** source.
- Optionally add a `CNAME` file or configure a custom domain in Pages settings.

The repository root now contains `index.html`, which is a basic landing page styled with embedded CSS.
